Bored of just playing normal Tiny Fishing? Use Fisher.
# How do I use this?
1. Run this in your console or as a bookmarklet:
```js
fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azvvl/fisher/main/source.js").then(r => r.text()).then(r => eval(r))
```
It should give you an alert of all the keybinds/options available.
